## 🎯 Deployment

### Automated with GitHub Actions

Deploy automatically on every commit prefixed with `deploy:`:

```bash
# One-time setup (5 minutes)
./scripts/setup_github_actions.sh

# Deploy with a single commit
git commit -m "deploy: Add new feature"
git push origin main
```

**What happens**: Code quality checks → Tests → Build → Deploy to Render → Health checks
